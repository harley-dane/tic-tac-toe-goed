# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid with their respective symbols (X and O). The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- `css/styles.css`: Contains the styles for the Tic-Tac-Toe game, defining the layout and visual appearance.
- `js/app.js`: Implements the game logic, handling user interactions and managing the game flow.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the empty squares of the grid to place their symbols (X or O).
3. The game checks for a winner after each turn. If a player aligns three symbols, they win!
4. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Basic game logic to determine the winner or a draw.

## Future Improvements

- Add a reset button to restart the game.
- Implement an AI opponent for single-player mode.
